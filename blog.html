Last week, Veia's was listed in the Rutgers Targum newspaper's "Top 100 New Online-Services for Middlesex County". They praised our website's wide variety of restaurant reviews in Middlesex County. They were particularly fond of the "Add a Restaurant" feature which allows our users to add a restaurant to our list of restaurants. They also found the simplistic design of the website easy to navigate and use.

Veia's is pleased to announce that in the upcoming months, we will update our mobile application to include many new and exciting features. One exciting feature is the "Find Restaurants Near Me" feature. This feature will give the user a list of restaurants that are closest to him or her. Furthermore, we are also planning to launch a Windows Phone 8 version of our mobile application. A tablet version for our mobile application for Android is also in the works. These developments were requested by our users. Please keep sending us more recommendations to enhance our service and your experience on Veia's.
